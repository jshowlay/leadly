{
  "primaryEmail": "Predict the most likely direct email using the website domain. Common patterns: info@domain.com, hello@domain.com, office@domain.com. If doctor name is in the practice name use firstname@domain.com. Extract domain from Website field.",
  "otherEmails": "1-2 alternative email patterns on the same domain, comma separated",
  "contactFormUrl": "Build the most likely contact page URL from the website. Append /contact, /contact-us, /appointment, or /book-appointment. For cosmetic/spa practices use /book-appointment. For general practices use /contact.",
  "emailSource": "Inferred from domain pattern",
  "emailRejectionReason": "Not yet verified — inferred address",
  "whyNow": "1-2 specific sentences on the timing signal that makes this practice worth contacting NOW. Reference their exact rating, review count, opportunity type, and city. Be specific, not generic.",
  "clusterNotes": "1-2 sentences on this practice's specific neighbourhood and market context — local competition density, area income level, demographics, and what that means for dental acquisition ROI.",
  "enrichmentNotes": "2-3 sentences of practice intelligence: service mix signals from name and branding (cosmetic vs general vs specialty), owner-operated vs group indicators, digital presence quality, and what the sales rep needs to know before making contact.",
  "apolloEnrichment": "Specific Apollo.io search instructions: if a doctor name is visible in the practice name search for them directly by name + DDS title + city. Otherwise search the practice name + city + Dentist or Owner title. Include the domain to search on."
}

Rules:
- Be specific to THIS practice — no generic filler text
- Extract the domain from the Website field for all email predictions
- Reference exact numbers and exact location in whyNow and clusterNotes`;
